            <p>You're beautiful<br>
                without even trying<br>
                but each time<br>
                I bring you a flower<br>
                it ends up dying<br>
                and you don't see<br>
                how I look at you<br>
                you just keep crying<br>
                and the saddest part<br>
                is that you're so special<br>
                but you think I'm lying
            </p>

        <div class="b">
            <p>
                Is that why you play the music so loud? A beat to drown out<br>
                the thoughts, sound so high you cannot think, lyrics so close<br>
                to home you don't even blink.
            </p>
