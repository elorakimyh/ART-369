            <u>comments:</u> <i>so hear me out. i didn't like raw fish at first so i always hated on pokemoto but i've been converted and now i occasionally enjoy a good pokemoto. also my friend from hawaii also used to hate on pokemoto because it's no where near authentic poke like in hawaii and obv that is indeed true but lowkey she be enjoying pokemoto recently too. i think the best trait about them is that they pack it up so it's so scrumptious and the all the flavors and mix-ins compliment each other well into a delicious mess. my goto on a lazy day. </i><br><br>
