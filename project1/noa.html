            <u>comments:</u> <i>i definitely do think noa tastes better than it's parent restaurant september in bangkok. they do asian fusion so well while still keeping the flavors of traditional thai cuisine. i heard that they were known for their drunken noodles. while they were good, i thought the star of the show was their pad see-ew with flank steak. the steak really adds to the dish and it has the perfect tenderness and flavor. would highly recommend trying that when you go although the second time i had it it wasn't as good as the first.</i><br><br>
