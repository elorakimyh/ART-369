            I am feeling anxious yet again. This is because I must get documentation for something tomorrow, and I don’t like drawing attention to myself, which I fear this will do.<br><br>
            This morning, we went to the grocery store and got a few things. I ordered my kratom from Pure Leaf, and it must have been on sale, as I got it for only $24. With the money I saved, I can make a payment on a bill that desperately needs catching up. I’m not behind on it, really, but I set a goal for myself regarding how quickly I wanted to pay it off and with everything that’s been going on, I got off track. I don’t like just paying the minimum on things.<br><br>
            I am feeling very anxious and jumpy today, but that’s par for the course.<br><br>
            No new news on Carrie’s cat.<br><br>
            I watched the debate. Vance was slick and smooth, but Walz was the one who was believable to me.
